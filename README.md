# 🐍 Python Crash Course – Working with Data

This project is based on **"Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes**, and focuses on **data visualization and analysis** using Python.  
The goal of this project is to explore how to **load, process, and visualize data** with Python’s built-in and external libraries.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

In this section of the book, we work with:

- **CSV files** – reading, writing, and extracting data
- **Plotting data** using **Matplotlib** and **Plotly**
- **Random walks** and **dice simulations**
- **Temperature and weather data visualizations**

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- Plotly
- CSV / JSON
- Pandas _(optional, for extended analysis)_

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/batar-btr/python_plots.git
   cd python-plots
   ```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
